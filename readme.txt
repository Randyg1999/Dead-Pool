Files that definitely need updating:

contestants.js ✅ - New celebrity picks and dates
check-deaths.js ✅ - Copy the new celebrity list
settings in contestants.js - Update the dates:

javascript   const settings = {
       "startDate": "2026-01-05",  // ← New year
       "endDate": "2027-01-06",    // ← New year
       "playerColors": { ... }     // Keep same unless players change
   };



iPhone users have to click the share button(square with an up arrow) and add to home screen, Andriod users should automatically see a banner to Add to home screen.  Users will then view the app from the icon and not through the browser if they want push notifications.

at the start of a new year also delete the gist for tracked deaths and notifications if some no longer wish to receive notifications, everyone will just have to resubscribe.

manifest.json, update year in the app name
